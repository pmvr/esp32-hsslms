esp32-hsslms
=============

This is an implementation of Leighton-Micali Hash-Based Signatures for an ESP32
according to `RFC 8554 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8554.html>`_ using the Arduino-IDE.

The implementation is based on the source code of `cpp-hsslms<https://github.com/pmvr/cpp-hsslms>`_ and is meant as a reference and for educational purposes.

The implementation provides 3 classes:

* LM-OTS One-Time Signatures. These are one-time signatures; each private key MUST be used at most one time to sign a message.
* Leighton-Micali Signatures (LMS). This systemholds a fixed number of one-time signatures, i.e.Â LM-OTS.
* Hierarchical Signatures (HSS). This system uses a sequence of LMS.


Performance Measurements of HSS
-------------------------------

The measurements are done on an ESP32. Because of limited resources Merkle trees of height 5 only can be computed.
